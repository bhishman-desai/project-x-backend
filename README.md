# Project X Backend

## Project Description

**Project X Backend** serves as the backbone for our ambitious Final Year Project, dedicated to Scaling Depression Levels Through Facial Image Processing and Social Media Analysis. This innovative system combines the power of OpenCV for facial expression detection and the Twitter API for extracting and analyzing emotions through textual data.

### Key Features:

- **Facial Expression Detection:** Leverage the capabilities of OpenCV to detect and analyze the facial expressions of users. The backend employs sophisticated algorithms to interpret emotional cues from facial images, contributing to the overall assessment of depression levels.

- **Twitter API Integration:** Connect seamlessly with the Twitter API to extract textual data from social media. By analyzing the language and sentiments expressed in tweets, the system adds a valuable layer of insight into the emotional state of users.

- **Data Fusion and Analysis:** The extracted facial expression and social media data are meticulously incorporated and analyzed. The backend processes this information to generate a final scaled result, providing a comprehensive understanding of the user's emotional well-being.

### Dependencies required for this project:
1. Tensorflow 1.7+
2. OpenCV 3.2+
